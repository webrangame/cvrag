LangChain RAG Application - Sample Document

What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models by allowing them to access external knowledge bases. This approach combines two key components:

1. Retrieval: The system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant information based on the user's query.

2. Generation: The retrieved information is used as context for the language model to generate accurate and informed responses.

How RAG Works
RAG systems work by following these steps:

1. Document Processing: Documents are processed and broken down into smaller chunks or tokens.
2. Embedding Creation: Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using an embedding model.
3. Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search.
4. Query Processing: When a user asks a question, the query is also converted to an embedding.
5. Similarity Search: The system finds the most relevant document chunks based on vector similarity.
6. Context Retrieval: The relevant chunks are retrieved and used as context.
7. Response Generation: The LLM generates a response using both the context and the original query.

Benefits of RAG
- Improved Accuracy: By providing relevant context, RAG systems can give more accurate answers.
- Up-to-date Information: Knowledge bases can be updated without retraining the model.
- Citation Support: Users can see the source of information.
- Cost-Effective: More efficient than fine-tuning models on new data.

Our Implementation
This RAG application uses:
- LangChain: For orchestrating the RAG pipeline
- Google Gemini: As the large language model
- ChromaDB: As the vector database for embeddings
- MySQL: For storing document metadata and chat history
- Streamlit: For the user interface

The application allows users to:
- Upload documents (PDF, TXT)
- Automatically process and chunk documents
- Store embeddings in ChromaDB
- Query documents using natural language
- View chat history stored in MySQL
